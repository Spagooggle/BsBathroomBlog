FAU Bathroom Blog	

1/16/26

PHYSICAL SCIENCE BUILDING PS 55

To start my blog, I figured this would be a good start. Any particular reason? No its just the bathroom where I decided I wanted to do this. I had this idea for a while, but never went with it. Well, today is the start, so let's get into the bathroom.

I went here around 1:30 pm on a Thursday, only another dude, and he was leaving, so I was gifted a quiet bathroom experience. The last stall I went to had piss all over it, so I unfortunately had to go to one of the middle stalls. Which was fine. Nothing wrong with it. Anyways I give this bathroom only when it's quiet, a 6.3. It didn't feel very clean, the atmosphere wasn't nice cause its squished in what seems to be a spare room. 

With these reviews/blog/public journal, I think I should split it up, with what people come for on top so you can just ignore my thoughts. I get it, I just want to see which bathroom is the best to take a shit in. Thats what I was thinking when I made this, so youre welcome.
