ENGINEERING EAST EE96 1st floor bathroom

Started writing this and I realized that I actually didn't go here today, so I walked out of class and went in. First of all, this is definitely one of the more “advanced” bathrooms. I would hope so, its the damn engineering building, the engineers would make their building nice. I walked in there to piss in the stall, but really couldn't to be honest. There was just a dude standing in the stall next to me. I heard nothing when I walked and nothing when I walked out! Besides this man admiring the bathroom scenery too, I’d give this bathroom a 7.5. I would go between classes obv since this is everyone's top choice after class.

I’m thinking of spreading QR codes around campus, just like a QR code and the blog name or something. If you are reading this from the QR code, well… thanks, looks like it worked. But if you just went to my website cause I told you about it , well, thanks for reading too. Anyone else just get super tired when driving 1+ hours? I seem to feel this way every time I drive to and from school. Which sucks too cause you’re driving a 2-ton steel machine going 80 mph with grandma and grandpa not knowing how to damn drive!

I get this feeling in class, too. I take CS classes, and some of them are just real snooze fests. I should really work on that, somehow. I wonder how long this blog will go downhill just like total off topic from what I originally wanted it to be. But that would also be really funny. Image a dude wanted to find a good spot to take a piss after class and he has to read these entries of a schizo. Alright see ya
