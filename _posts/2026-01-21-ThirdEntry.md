Breeze-Way Bathrooms


I figured this should be one of the first bathrooms to review. How couldn't I, this is a major bathroom(s). I would compare these bathrooms to like D-Day, I'm not even kidding here. So many people, odd layout, dirty, dim, wet, gross, uncomfortable, scary, and many other bad adjectives. Every time I go piss here I feel like I'm gonna get shanked and robbed, that's the atmosphere of the bathroom. You have to go to stall here fellas, if you value your life. Now I'm exaggerating here but you get the point. And why does FAU split it so weird. I feel like everyday the men's and women's bathroom gets switched around. Why have a dedicated women's and men's and then a combo? Why don't you make them all combos? That makes the most sense. But no. I give this bathroom a 3.2 on my rating.


You know what I hate too other then this bathroom? When your in class with the door open and the 5th campus tour goes by and points at you and your class. Like "Woah Jimmy look! students!" like were a God damn petting zoo! So many tours, no wonder the dorms here are full. You know I was one of the ones who were screwed with housing. I bet many in my year. When I was a freshmen, seniors had housing priority. Then when I became a junior it switched and yep no more housing. So I have to drive 1+ hour basically everyday to be gawked at. Cool, yeah pretty cool. Do you think professors remember faces of their students like we remember theirs? I had a professor from one of my higher classes walk by and make eye contact with me in a class that's like for freshmen ( thanks advisor). Do I think he remembered? Probably not, they see hundreds of people a day anyways and I never like talked to him after class. 


Tad bit cold here, a blistering artic front of 70 degrees. While everyone else in the country has like 2 feet of snow. Whatever, I'd prefer to be cold at 70 then to actually freeze at like 20. Lot easier to deal with things when like 40 is your all time low here. I found a website that can make QR codes of the website url. I'll check it out after posting this and maybe print a few. I dont have staples though, so may just leave them around bathrooms. That would be funny.
